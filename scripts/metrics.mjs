/**
 * PAR-652 item 9 — the project's status numbers, printed for a human to paste.
 *
 *   node scripts/metrics.mjs
 *
 * Deliberately NOT wired to a schedule or to an issue tracker — this prints numbers for a
 * human to read, not a cron job that posts them into a tracker where they will rot.
 *
 * It reads the repository's public, unauthenticated figures from api.github.com:
 * open issues, stars and forks.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO install count. VibeCTX is distributed as source — users clone
 * and build — and a clone is not observable from here: GitHub's traffic/clones endpoint
 * requires push access to the repository, and the npm download counts this script used to
 * print now measure an abandoned channel (the last version published to npm was 0.1.2, in
 * July 2026). Printing a stale npm number as if it were adoption would be worse than
 * printing nothing, so this script prints nothing for it and says why.
 *
 * HONEST DEGRADATION is the design constraint, because reachability is not a given:
 * api.github.com answers 403 through the agent sandbox's proxy while resolving normally
 * from an ordinary machine, so the same script legitimately prints figures in one place and
 * `unknown` in another. Do not encode either as a fact — let the run report what it found.
 * A number this script cannot obtain is never printed as `0` — a zero is a measurement and
 * would be a lie here. It prints what it could not reach and why, and it
 * exits 0 either way: not knowing is a normal outcome, not a failure of the script.
