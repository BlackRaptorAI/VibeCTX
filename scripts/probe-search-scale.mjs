/**
 * D-37/D-43 — the SECOND row of the README's scale table, measured rather than remembered.
 *
 *   npm run build && node scripts/probe-search-scale.mjs
 *
 * `test/search-perf.test.ts` prints the first row (5.63 MB in 12 documents) on every run,
 * because that is the shape D-37 sets its 300 ms budget over. The second row is the shape a
 * reader wants when they ask what happens at thirty full `llms-full.txt` documents, and it is
 * too slow and too large to run inside the suite — so it lives here, as a script, and the
 * README cites the script rather than a number nobody can reproduce.
 *
 * What it prints is the row itself: corpus size and document count, the index file and what
 * fraction of the corpus it is, warm `search` time (best–worst of several runs), and the
 * one-off cost of building the index.
 *
 * The corpus is generated, never fetched: no network, deterministic, and the same prose shape
 * as the perf test's fixture (the same recurring vocabulary, so IDF has work to do and the
 * index is priced on realistic — not pathological — vocabulary). Everything is written to a
 * temporary directory and deleted on the way out.
 *
 * Tunables, all optional:
 *   PROBE_DOCS=30            documents in the corpus
 *   PROBE_SECTIONS=2230      sections per document (~4.8 MB each at this prose size)
 *   PROBE_WARM_RUNS=5        warm searches to time
 *   PROBE_KEEP=1             leave the corpus and index on disk, and print where they are
