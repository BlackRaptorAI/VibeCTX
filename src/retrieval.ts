 *  applies here too: one place states the fact, every render path calls it) — and, per
 *  security-architect's A17 round-1 finding S-1, the same lesson applies to the CLEANING too:
 *  `url` is cleaned and clipped HERE, not left to each caller's own convention. Before this,
 *  `search.ts` clipped its copy (`MAX_URL_CHARS`) but `get-docs.ts` passed `doc.url` raw — a
 *  config-authored entry's URL is validated for scheme/host (`link-policy.ts`) but never
 *  re-serialized, so an embedded control character or newline could survive into a rendered
 *  stamp on the get_docs path only. One shared function is what makes "clean once, here" an
 *  actual guarantee rather than a convention two callers could independently forget. (PAR-811:
 *  `stripStampQuery`'s successful-parse branch DOES now re-serialize through `new URL().href`
 *  for its own reason — stripping the query/fragment/userinfo — with side effects beyond that
 *  one goal: lower-cased host, a normalized default port, resolved `.`/`..` path segments, an
 *  added trailing slash on a bare origin, and punycode on a non-ASCII host. All of those are
 *  either invisible or a strict improvement for this render path — punycoding in particular
 *  defuses the exact IDN-homograph shape S-1 exists to guard against — but the parse-FAILURE
 *  fallback below still returns the ORIGINAL, un-re-serialized string, so this paragraph's
 *  claim stays load-bearing on that branch.)
 *
 *  A11/PAR-724 closes the gap the comment here used to record (D-73: A17 shipped with no
 *  version/ref field because A11 had not been built): `version`, below, is the version or ref
 *  the document was actually matched to — set only when the resolution chain found a
 *  version-SPECIFIC document (a GitHub tag README, an npm/PyPI version-pinned metadata
 *  lookup), never merely echoing back what was requested. When a version was requested but no
 *  versioned document could be found, the stamp says nothing about a version at all — the

 * anywhere for custom headers or credentials — so a token in a config entry's `urls`
 * (`?token=…`, a realistic internal-docs pattern) is not a misuse case, it is the undocumented
 * way to do the one thing this tool doesn't otherwise support. Left unstripped, that token
 * reached the model's own context on every `get_docs`/`search` call this stamp appears in — a
 * wider exposure than any on-disk cache file, since it leaves the process on every response
 * rather than sitting in a local file. Same fix, same reasoning, as `activity-log.ts`'s
 * `sanitizeLoggedUrl` (D-51/PAR-792): strip the query and the fragment (rarely survives this
 * far — `link-policy.ts`'s `sanitizeRemoteUrl` already clears it on most paths — stripped
 * again here so this function does not depend on that holding) AND, since PAR-811 round 2
 * (security-architect, S-1), userinfo — `https://svc:s3cr3t@host/…` is the OTHER syntax a
 * credential can travel in a URL, and unlike the query string it is not gated by any
 * upstream validator on every path: a cache hit's `finalUrl` (`fetcher.ts`'s
 * `DocResult.finalUrl`) is read back from the persisted cache record through `cache-meta.ts`'s
 * `validMetaUrl`, which checks only length and parseability, not scheme or userinfo — a cache
 * directory written before PAR-776 round 1 (N-3, when `fetcher.ts`'s `isPublicHttpsUrl` first
 * started rejecting userinfo on a redirect hop) can still hold one today. This function clears
 * it unconditionally rather than depending on that gate holding, exactly as it already does
 * for the query string — `sanitizeLoggedUrl` does the same, and this comment previously
 * claimed that parity before it was actually true.
 *
 * Falls back to the ORIGINAL string on a parse failure: `f.url` is already a fetched or
 * config-validated URL by the time it reaches this render path, not something this function is
 * positioned to refuse — best-effort stripping, never a new way for the stamp to go missing.
 *
 * security-architect S-1 (Phase 3, round 2) — exported and reused by `get-docs.ts`'s `!doc`
 * branch (the "could not fetch, nothing cached" response) for the same reason it exists here:
 * `entry.urls` there is the raw, config-authored candidate list, just as capable of carrying a
 * `?token=…` as `doc.url`/`doc.finalUrl` are, and it was echoing that query string straight into
 * a rendered response — the same leak class this function was built to close, one call site it
 * had not yet reached.
 *
 * SCOPE (PAR-811's own issue, stated plainly): this closes the leak for the rendered TEXT
 * stamp only — `GetDocsOutcome.source.url` / `SearchGroup.url` (the structured, --json fields)
 * are untouched. NOT because they "never leave the process" (code-reviewer, round 1: false for
 * BOTH, not just one — `vibectx search --json` serializes `SearchGroup.url` via `cli.ts`'s
 * `io.stdout(JSON.stringify(outcome, …))`, and `GetDocsOutcome.source.url` reaches stdout the
 * same way, through `doctor.ts`'s `LibraryReport.url` on `vibectx doctor --json` — round 2
 * caught this comment still singling out search as if get_docs's own structured field stayed
 * contained, which it does not; `get-docs.ts`'s own doc comment on `source` even says this
 * field exists BECAUSE doctor consumes it). The actual reason these are deferred is narrower
 * and is the one that matters here — neither surface reaches a MODEL's context the way a
 * rendered response does, and closing a machine-readable field is a different, deferred
 * question (the 0.2.1 redaction policy below), not an oversight in this fix. It does not add a
 * general redaction policy, and it does not add a real authenticated-fetch mechanism (custom
 * headers, say) so a credential never has to travel in a URL at all — both stay open,
 * deliberately deferred to 0.2.1, not folded into this fix.

 * Step 2 is what makes the cap hold when the OVERHEAD alone is over budget: a snippet
 * whose heading path, context line and language are all attacker-supplied is bounded at
 * 200 + 200 + 20 characters by D-30, but `maxTokens` can be smaller than that. No field
