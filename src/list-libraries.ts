 *  index-only with no link followed successfully, or a probe that returned no match — a fact
 *  the cache-status and kind brackets alone do not carry (PAR-704: a source can be cleanly
 *  cached and still fail every probe). Absent entirely when doctor has never checked the
 *  entry, so "no note" never overclaims health the way `unknown` for the kind bracket already
 *  declines to. Deliberately states only the closed `kind` enum and the check date, never
 *  doctor's free-text `reasons` — the persisted verdict store is process-global while a
 *  library's config is per-project, so free text from one project's `doctor` run could
 *  otherwise leak into another project's response (security-architect, A19/PAR-728 round 1,
 *  S-1). When `vibectx warm` has a record for the working directory, one closing line
 *  summarises it. Never touches the network. */
