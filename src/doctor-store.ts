 * Persistence for `vibectx doctor`'s per-library verdict (A19/PAR-728): `<cacheRoot>/doctor.json`,
 * shape `{ schemaVersion: 1, verdicts: [ { name, kind, healthy, reasons, checkedAt } ] }`.
 *
 * `runDoctor` computes `LibraryReport[]` fresh, in memory, on every call — nothing persisted it
 * before this. Without a persisted verdict, `list_libraries` and `get_docs` have no way to warn
 * that a library which LOOKS cached and healthy actually failed its last probe (the PAR-704
 * fastify shape: index-only, topic queries return "No sections matched", yet `list_libraries`
 * reported it cached with no error) short of re-running a probe on every call — which
 * `list_libraries` is documented never to do (it touches only the cache) and `get_docs` cannot
 * afford per response. So doctor's verdict is written here once, and read back cheaply.
 *
 * The file is a trust boundary (K1, mirroring `resolved-store.ts`): anything with write access
 * to the cache directory can edit it, so every record is re-validated field by field on read —
 * ONE invalid field drops the WHOLE record (never a partially-trusted one, matching
 * `resolved-store.ts`'s own `urls` handling: "a bad element is not skipped, the whole record is
 * untrusted") — and a corrupt file reads as empty rather than throwing.
 *
 * security-architect (A19/PAR-728 round 1, S-1, BLOCKING): the cache directory — and so this
 * file — is process-global, while a library's registry entry, URLs and config are PER PROJECT.
 * Persisting `reasons` (built in part from config-authored `probeQueries` text, and from raw
 * error messages that can carry filesystem paths or internal hostnames) and rendering it in
 * ANOTHER project's `list_libraries`/`get_docs` output would leak that text across a boundary
 * neither side chose. Fixed by never rendering `reasons` in a cross-project-visible surface at
 * all — `list-libraries.ts` and `get-docs.ts` render only the closed `kind` enum and the
 * `checkedAt` date, never free text. `reasons` is still persisted (useful for a same-project
 * `vibectx doctor --json` reader) and still cleaned/clipped here on read, as defence in depth,
 * but no caller may treat that cleaning as sufficient to render it across a project boundary.

 * and is left alone — returns `false`, with a note via `warn`, rather than overwriting it.
 * Mirrors `resolved-store.ts`'s `saveResolvedEntry` / `project-store.ts`'s `writeProjectRecord`

 * caller, which already has to build its own report notes around this call (D-13) the same way

 * throws here, on the one write this process controls, rather than writing a record only a
