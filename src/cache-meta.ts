 * D-71 (PAR-749) — the ONE shared answer to "does this file belong to this key?". Every
 * `.meta.json` PARSE in the cache layer goes through `readMetaFile`/`toCacheMeta` here:
 * directly, from `cache.ts`'s `readCache`, `touchCache` and `dropFollowedPageCache`, and from
 * `cache-evict.ts`'s `resolveRecency` (in turn called by `enforceCacheSizeCap` — it has no
 * meta-parsing call of its own, since its DELETE decision deliberately does not need the
 * provenance proof `dropFollowedPageCache` does; see `enforceCacheSizeCap`'s own docstring).
 * `writeCache` participates by construction, not by calling into this module: it always writes
 * a meta whose `url` is the one just fetched, under the name `urlSlug`/`libDirName` derive from
 * that same URL. Extracted to its own module (rather than left in `cache.ts`, which
 * `cache-evict.ts` already has a reverse import relationship with via `noteCacheWrite`) so
 * neither file has to import the other for it.
 *
 * Two roots, one file:
 *   Root 1 — `urlSlug`/`libDirName` were lossy name folds used as storage keys with no
 *   collision check: two distinct URLs (or library names) differing only in a character the
 *   fold maps to `_` produced the SAME file name, and nothing on the read side compared a
 *   record's own identity against what was actually requested. Two independent fixes, both
 *   present: the folds now append a short hash of the FULL input (collision-RESISTANT, not a
 *   mathematical guarantee — see `urlSlug`'s own comment for what is and isn't load-bearing
 *   about that), and `readCache`/`touchCache` (`cache.ts`) additionally compare the meta's own
 *   `url` against the URL actually requested, which is what actually makes serving the wrong
 *   document impossible on the URL dimension regardless of hash collisions.
 *   Root 2 — `.meta.json` had four readers at four different trust levels (a strict
 *   per-field validator in `cache.ts`, a provenance round-trip in `dropFollowedPageCache`, a
 *   lax ad-hoc parse in `cache-evict.ts`'s recency read, and no check at all in
 *   `enforceCacheSizeCap`'s eviction decision). `toCacheMeta`/`readMetaFile` are now the one
 *   validator every reader calls, at the one trust level (including the `MAX_META_FILE_BYTES`
 *   size bound, enforced inside `readMetaFile` itself so every caller gets it for free).

 *              (`link-policy.ts`) — https only, no userinfo, ≤ 2048 characters, and the host

 *              value merely shaped like a URL here would let a hand-edited or corrupted
 *              `.meta.json` hand a caller an attacker-chosen "trusted" origin — a live fetch's
 *              redirect can never legitimately produce a `finalUrl` this check would reject
 *              (`fetcher.ts`'s `hopAllowed` enforces exactly this same rule, unconditionally, on

 *              for the same reason `etag` is: it is provenance about where the fetch landed, not
 *              part of this entry's identity (`url`, the CANDIDATE, is what `readCache`/

 *
 * The load-bearing guarantee on THIS dimension is not the hash alone: `readCache` and

 * CHECK IS INDEPENDENT OF THE FILENAME'S HASH, and for one round of this phase it briefly was
 * not: `CacheMeta.urlHash` (below) was originally the SAME 12-character, 48-bit `shortHash` this
 * slug's own suffix uses, which made the "near-impossible event" above a genuinely feasible
 * ~2^48 offline attack — grind a same-origin, attacker-reachable URL (e.g. a followed index
 * link, which `isAllowedLink` grants a document's own host unconditionally) until its 48-bit
 * hash collides with a real target document's, and both the filename AND the identity check
 * would then agree, wrongly. Fixed by making `urlHashFor` the FULL, untruncated 64-character
 * SHA-256 digest — a completely different value from this slug's own 12-character suffix, so a
 * forced collision on the filename's cheap 48-bit hash no longer also satisfies the identity
 * check's full-strength one. The 12-character suffix here stays exactly as before (unaffected
 * filenames, unaffected collision-resistance-for-directory-listings characterisation above); it
 * is simply no longer asked to double as a security-critical identity proof.
 *
 * PAR-806 (Phase 4) — the FOLDED PREFIX is now computed from the REDACTED url
 * (`redactUrlForDisplay`, query/fragment/userinfo stripped), not the raw one: this prefix
 * "carries none of the uniqueness guarantee" (unchanged claim, see above) and exists purely
 * for a human glancing at the cache directory — so this change costs nothing on correctness
 * and closes the actual leak (a token's alphanumerics no longer appear in the FILE NAME at
 * all). The HASH suffix is unchanged: still `shortHash` of the FULL, untruncated, RAW url,
 * because two candidate URLs differing only by query string (`?v=2` vs `?v=3`) are legitimately
 * DIFFERENT documents (D-71's own design) and must keep producing different slugs — redacting
 * the hash's input too would make them collide. Consequence, stated plainly (DECISIONS.md

 * and, as a side effect of `redactUrlForDisplay`'s own documented normalization (PAR-818), a url
 * with a non-default-cased host, an explicit default port or a non-ASCII host. An existing cache
 * entry for such a url, written under the OLD formula, is not found by a NEW `readCache` call for

 *  `CacheMeta.urlHash` — the FULL, untruncated 64-character SHA-256 digest of the raw url, via
 *  `fullHash`, NOT `shortHash`'s 12-character filename truncation.
 *
 *  WHY THIS MUST BE A DIFFERENT VALUE FROM THE FILENAME'S HASH, stated plainly because getting
 *  this wrong once already shipped a real regression: before this correction, `urlHashFor`
 *  returned `shortHash(url)` — LITERALLY the same 48-bit value already embedded as `urlSlug`'s
 *  own hash suffix, adding no independent dimension at all. Before PAR-806 existed, `readCache`'s
 *  identity check was a full, untruncated STRING comparison (`meta.url !== url`) — independent
 *  of the filename mechanism entirely, so even a forced filename collision left the identity
 *  check free to catch the mismatch by comparing the two full raw strings. Collapsing the
 *  identity proof onto the SAME 48-bit filename hash silently deleted that independence: an
 *  attacker who can get content written into the same per-library directory as a target
 *  document (a same-origin followed index link is enough — `isAllowedLink` grants a document's
 *  own host unconditionally) can grind a query-string suffix until their URL's 48-bit hash
 *  equals the target's (~2^48 SHA-256 evaluations, single-GPU hours, entirely offline, no
 *  interaction with this process). Their write then lands under the exact same filename AND
 *  passes the identity check, and the next legitimate read serves their content as the real
 *  document — exactly the "wrong document served under the wrong identity" outcome D-71 exists
 *  to make near-impossible, reopened by this phase and closed again here.
 *
 *  A full 256-bit digest makes a targeted second-preimage attack computationally infeasible
 *  (not merely "not cheap" — outside any realistic attacker's reach), restoring the SAME
 *  strength the pre-PAR-806 raw string comparison had, just carried by a hash instead of the
 *  plaintext (the whole point of PAR-806 in the first place: identical security property, no
 *  secret on disk). Filenames are completely unaffected — the 12-character suffix `urlSlug`
 *  computes is still `shortHash`, unchanged, so no cache filename changes as a result of this
 *  fix. `MAX_META_FILE_BYTES` (8192) has ample headroom for the ~52 extra bytes this adds per
 *  entry — verified against its own sizing comment (already generous for two 2048-character URL
 *  fields plus a 512-character etag); not bumped, because it does not need to be. */

/**
 * D-71 (PAR-749, Root 1) — the library-directory half of the same fix. `libDirIn`'s fold
 * (`[^a-z0-9_-]` → `_`) let two distinct, independently valid npm names — `foo.bar` and
 * `foo_bar` — share one directory; refreshing one could delete the other's cached primary (see
 * `dropFollowedPageCache`'s history). Collision-resistant for the same reason `urlSlug` is
 * (see `shortHash`'s comment) — but UNLIKE the URL dimension, there is no second, independent
 * check on this one: a library name is not itself stored in `.meta.json`, so a forced
 * directory-name collision has no `readCache`-style equality check to fall back on. Accepted:
 * the attacker's input space here (a package/library name reaching a user's own dependency
 * list or `vibectx.config.json`) is far narrower than an arbitrary URL, and the worst case is
 * loss of re-fetchable cache (availability), never wrong content served as right. Capped at
 * 120 characters before the hash, matching `urlSlug`, so an unbounded library name (nothing
 * enforces a maximum length on one — security-architect, D-71 round 2, S4) cannot push the
 * directory name toward a filesystem `NAME_MAX`; the hash is still of the FULL, uncapped name,
 * so truncating the visible prefix costs nothing on the collision-resistance side.

 * suffix is, and must stay, `shortHash` (the 12-char truncation), even though `meta.urlHash`
 * itself is now the full 64-character digest (security-architect, Phase 4 round 2, B1 — see
 * `urlHashFor`'s own comment for why the two are deliberately different lengths/values). No raw
 * url is ever needed here: `meta.urlHash`'s first 12 characters ARE `shortHash(rawUrl)` by
 * construction (`fullHash` and `shortHash` share the same prefix). OLD-FORMAT meta (no
 * `urlHash`: a file written before this item, where `url` is still the RAW candidate): falls
 * back to the original `urlSlug(meta.url) === slug` round trip, unchanged — this is what lets
 * an old-format file keep being recognised as its own slug's owner without needing to be
 * rewritten.
 *
 * `dropFollowedPageCache` uses this spelling of the rule because it has no request URL to
 * compare against — only a filename it is deciding whether to delete, and the URL a candidate
 * SHOULD have (via the slug it is named for) is all there is to check it against.
