/**
 * PAR-817/PAR-816/PAR-818 (Phase 4) — THE ONE shared "make a URL safe to show or store"
 * function, consolidating what were three independent, near-duplicate implementations:
 * `retrieval.ts`'s `stripStampQuery` (PAR-811), `activity-log.ts`'s `sanitizeLoggedUrl`
 * (PAR-792, which `stripStampQuery`'s own comment already said it "deliberately mirrors"),
 * and this file's own `sanitizeRemoteUrl` (fragment-only, and also a VALIDATOR — see its own
 * comment for why it stays separate: this function does redaction, not trust decisions, and
 * lives here only because `link-policy.ts` is a low-level module every other file can import
 * without a cycle — verified: this file does not import `retrieval.ts` or `activity-log.ts`,
 * and nothing it exports needs to).
 *
 * Clears the query string, the fragment AND userinfo (username/password) — PAR-816's
 * consolidated hardening: neither `stripStampQuery` nor `sanitizeLoggedUrl` cleared userinfo
 * before PAR-811 round 2 added it to the stamp path alone, and this is the one place that
 * gap can no longer reopen in a fourth copy.
 *
 * PAR-816 — FAILS TOWARD SAFETY ON A PARSE FAILURE, NEVER TOWARD "return the raw string
 * whole": every current producer of a value that reaches this function has already been
 * validated by `sanitizeRemoteUrl`/`validateLibraryUrl` upstream, so a parse failure here
 * should be unreachable in practice — but this function's own safety must not rest on an
 * unstated cross-module invariant holding forever. On a parse failure this cuts the string at
 * its first `?` or `#` (PAR-816's own suggested fix) rather than returning it unchanged: a
 * string this function cannot even parse as a URL is exactly the shape most likely to be
 * garbage that still happens to contain a `?token=…`-shaped tail, and cutting it is strictly
 * safer than passing it through whole. This can still leave userinfo in an unparseable string
 * (there is no reliable, generic way to find `user:pass@` without a URL parser succeeding) —
 * a narrower residual than the pre-fix behaviour, not a new one.
 *
 * PAR-818 — DOCUMENTED NORMALIZATION SIDE EFFECT, not a bug to suppress: on a successful
 * parse, `new URL(url).href` also lower-cases the host, punycodes a non-ASCII host, drops an
 * explicit default port, resolves `.`/`..` path segments and adds a trailing slash to a bare
 * origin — all as a consequence of the round-trip this function needs anyway to clear
 * `.search`/`.hash`/`.username`/`.password`. Every one of those is either invisible or a
 * strict improvement for a render/storage path (punycoding in particular defuses an
 * IDN-homograph URL) — see `test/link-policy.test.ts` for the pinned case
 * (`https://Docs.Example.COM:443/x` → `https://docs.example.com/x`).
