/**
 * D-38 — THE RETRIEVAL VERSION. Bump this by one whenever you change ANY of:
 *
 *   1. `tokenize` or `stem` (this file) — the tokens a document is stored under;
 *   2. `splitSections` (retrieval.ts) — which section a token belongs to, and how many there are;
 *   3. `HEADING_WEIGHT` / `weighSections` (retrieval.ts) — the frequencies the postings hold.
 *
 * Why a version and not just the content hash the search index already keeps: the hash proves
 * the DOCUMENT is unchanged, which is exactly why a change to the code above slips past it. An
 * index built by yesterday's tokenizer describes the same bytes under different terms, so
 * today's query looks up terms that are not there and the answer is silently EMPTY rather than
 * visibly wrong. MEASURED by the PAR-659 schema gate: deleting the `ies→y` stemmer rule made a
 * surviving index return zero groups where a freshly built one returns the right section.
 *
 * `readIndex` refuses a file whose `retrievalVersion` is not this one, exactly as it refuses a
 * stale hash: the postings are rebuilt from the cache, never used. So bumping this costs one
 * slower search per library and nothing else; NOT bumping it costs correctness.
 *
 * It lives HERE, in the leaf module, rather than beside the code it mostly guards, so that
 * every module it versions can import it without a cycle — retrieval.ts imports this file, and
 * search-index.ts imports both.

 * parse/parsing/parsed/parses, create/creating/created, use/uses/used, run/running,

 * query/queries/querying, and — since repair (d) — note/noted/noting, type/typed/typing,
 * base/based, name/named, code/coded/coding, size/sized/sizing, page/paged/paging all
 * converge.
 *
 * Non-convergences that remain, and the reason for each (pinned by
 * "pins the remaining documented non-convergences and over-stems"):
 *   - `using` ≠ `use`. It is a stopword, so no real query reaches the stemmer with it;
 *     standing alone, `ing` → `us` is under the floor and it keeps its own form.
 *   - `handler` ≠ `handle`. There is no agent-noun rule: an `er` rule would also merge
 *     `router` into `route` and `parser` into `parse`, which loses more than it gains.
 *   - `embed` (→ `emb`) ≠ `embedded` (→ `embed`). `ed` is not a suffix in `embed`, and
 *     `emb` is not CVC, so repair (d) cannot put it right; no rule can tell the two apart
 *     without a lexicon.
 *
 * Over-stems — two words folded onto one token — and why each is tolerated:
 *   - `seed` → `see`. `seed` and `use`+`d` are both consonant-vowel-vowel-`d`; the `d`-cut
 *     that carries `used` → `use` cannot avoid carrying `seed` → `see`.
 *   - `stripe` → `strip`, `middleware` → `middlewar`. The silent-e cut over-stems nouns
 *     that merely end in `e`.
 * Queries and documents go through the same function, so a collision costs precision,
 * never a match.
 *
 * D-38: BUMP `RETRIEVAL_VERSION` (top of this file) WHEN YOU CHANGE ANY RULE HERE. The search
 * index stores documents under their STEMS; change a rule and every posting list on disk is
 * keyed to the old stems while queries arrive as the new ones, which the content hash cannot
 * see. MEASURED: deleting the `ies→y` rule made a surviving index return zero groups.
