 * The previous "spends the budget ACROSS libraries" case ran on a corpus where EVERY library
 * had exactly one matching section, so `groups.length >= 2` and `sections.length === 1` were
 * arithmetic rather than behaviour: depth-first selection passed it unchanged. This corpus is
 * built so the two strategies give visibly different answers — one library owns FOUR matching
 * sections, and the budget has room for about three sections in total. Round-robin spreads
 * them across three libraries; depth-first would spend them all inside the first.
 *
 * Sections are long on purpose (~1 KB each), because the budget defect the review and schema
 * gates MEASURED — 9.9× at the default, 97× at `maxTokens: 200`, 322× on their fixture — only
 * shows on a corpus whose bodies are big enough to overrun it.

 * the loop one level up: `search` rebuilt the shed library's posting list on every call, merged
 * it, and handed `writeIndex` a payload that shed the very same entry again — so the whole file
 * was re-serialised and re-written, every search, for ever, for no change at all.
 *
 * MEASURED by the security gate on a real corpus: 64,016,652 bytes rewritten in 14.5–14.7 s per
 * call, indefinitely. The fixture here reproduces the SHAPE cheaply — a nearly-full index file
 * planted directly, plus one cached document whose posting list is the largest entry, so it is
 * the one D-40 sheds — and prints its own figures.
 *
 * The fix is a per-process "too big to index" memo (the shape `warm`'s recent-failure memo
 * already has): `writeIndex` records what it shed, and `search` neither rebuilds nor rewrites
 * that entry again in this process. What must NOT change: the shed library is still SEARCHED,
