/**
 * A10 — the one file no other test executes: `src/index.ts`, compiled to `dist/index.js`
 * and launched exactly as an MCP client launches it — `spawn(node, [dist/index.js])`, real
 * stdin/stdout, no `InMemoryTransport`. `test/server.test.ts` proves the tool set and the
 * autowarm/close wiring against `startServer` directly; this file proves the process wrapped
 * around it: the top-level `await dispatchCli`, the `process.exit(2)` config-error path
 * (index.ts:40), and a real spawned process — real pipes, a real MCP `initialize`/`tools/list`
 * handshake over stdio — exiting cleanly (code 0, no signal, no stderr) within
 * `EXIT_CEILING_MS` after its stdin is closed.
 *
 * PARTIALLY CLOSED (A5, PAR-718): `process.exitCode = cliExit` at index.ts:21-22, the path
 * taken when a subcommand (`doctor`/`resolve`/`warm`/`search`) runs, was a genuine, named gap
 * through Phase 2 — neither spawn above passes a subcommand, and `test/cli.test.ts` /
 * `test/autowarm.test.ts` call `dispatchCli` in-process, never spawning `dist/index.js`. Gate
 * 3 required the `resolve` and `search` subcommands specifically, against a REAL read-only
 * cache directory, "so an unhandled rejection cannot hide behind an in-process test" — the
 * describe block below closes that much (a real spawn, real subcommand args, a real chmod'd
 * directory) via `search`, the network-free half; `resolve`'s equivalent is proven at the
 * in-process level instead (`test/cli.test.ts`'s "A5 (PAR-718)" test), because a spawned child
 * cannot see this file's own `vi.stubGlobal("fetch")` and a real-network spawn test does not
 * belong in the required CI job — see the round-2 note on the describe block below for the
 * full reasoning. `doctor` and `warm` still take the untested path (still index.ts:21-22,
 * still only reachable through this exact wiring) — not required by A5, not claimed here.
 *
 * `index.ts:21-22`'s ASSIGNMENT specifically (not just "search runs and prints something"):
 * a code-0 spawn alone cannot prove `process.exitCode = cliExit` actually carries a NON-zero
 * code out of a real process — 0 is Node's own default, so a no-op in that line's place would
 * leave a code-0-only test green too (test-auditor, A5 round 2). The describe block below
 * therefore pins BOTH a success (0) and a usage-error (2) spawn of the same subcommand, the
 * second network-free and requiring no seeded cache — a mutant that drops the assignment
 * turns the second one red without changing the first.
 *
 * What this file does NOT prove, corrected after a round-2 review caught the claim below being
 * false (mutation-tested: deleting index.ts:46 entirely and rebuilding still leaves THIS FILE
 * green): it does NOT prove `process.stdin.once("end", …)` at index.ts:46 specifically fires.
 * Every test here runs with `VIBECTX_NO_AUTOWARM=1`, so `autowarmStatus().inFlight.size` is
 * always 0 and index.ts:46's handler is never the thing keeping the event loop open — nothing
 * is. When stdin ends, Node's own event loop drains and the child exits on its own, with or
 * without index.ts:46 existing. Proving the handler actually fires and does something would
 * require an in-flight autowarm-shaped condition to hold the loop open without hitting the
 * network (`src/link-policy.ts` blocks loopback/private hosts on the normal fetch path), which
 * is a `src/` change out of this file's scope.
 *
 * Round-4 review mutation-tested the line's DELETION suite-wide (not just this file): deleting
 * index.ts:46 entirely, rebuilding, and running the FULL suite gives `1 failed | 1060 passed` —
 * `test/autowarm.test.ts:248` carries a source tripwire that regex-matches this exact line's
 * text (`expect(index).toMatch(/process\.stdin\.once\("end", ...\)/)`), so the line's PRESENCE
 * is caught suite-wide even though this file alone would not catch it. What remains genuinely
 * untested anywhere in the suite is the line's BEHAVIOR — that the handler actually fires and
 * closes the server when stdin ends — which is the honest, narrower gap. What IS proven here,
 * and is a meaningful upgrade over no process-level test at all: the process starts, answers
 * real MCP calls over real stdio, and exits promptly and cleanly — no hang, no signal, no
 * stack, no stderr noise — when its client goes away. A `process.exit(2)` flipped to a
 * different code, or the exit code/signal/timing assertions below being wrong, would be caught
 * by this file; index.ts:46's handler being deleted would not be caught by this file alone, but
 * is caught by the suite as a whole via the tripwire above.
 *
 * Requires `dist/index.js`, built fresh by the `beforeAll` below. This is necessary because
 * CI's own `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `npm test` before `npm run build`, so on a clean
 * checkout `dist/` does not exist yet when this file runs; `dist/` is also gitignored, so
 * nothing here can assume a prior manual build either. The `beforeAll` builds unconditionally
 * (not just when `dist/index.js` is missing) so a stale local `dist/` — built from an older
 * `src/` — can never produce a false-positive pass.
 *
 * Handshake: written by hand rather than through the SDK's `Client` / `StdioClientTransport`,
 * because the client transport's own `close()` races a 2 s timeout and falls back to
 * `SIGTERM`/`SIGKILL` — exactly the ambiguity this test exists to remove. Talking newline-
 * delimited JSON-RPC directly means the only thing that ends the child's stdin is the single
 * `child.stdin.end()` call below, and the only thing that ends the child is its own shutdown
 * path (whatever that turns out to be at runtime — see the note above on what is and is not
 * pinned to index.ts:46 specifically).
