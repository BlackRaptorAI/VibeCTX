/**
 * A3 (PAR-716) · one index session for the whole refresh loop, not one read-then-write per
 * library — the same R2 fix `warm` and `autowarm` already carry (search-index.ts:495-508).
 *
 * Counted at the `node:fs` boundary, the same technique `search-index-session.test.ts` uses
 * for the identical claim about `warm`, and for the identical reason: the win is invisible in
 * the RESULT (the index file ends up byte-identical either way), so only counting the raw
 * reads and writes of `index.json` proves the session was actually shared across the loop
 * rather than opened and closed per library.
 *
 * WHAT "one session" ACTUALLY COSTS, measured here rather than assumed: when at least one
 * library's content CHANGED, `add()`'s lazy snapshot reads once; `flush()` re-reads once more
 * before merging, by design, so a concurrent writer is merged rather than clobbered
 * (search-index.ts:503-504, unchanged by this item); `writeIndex()` itself reads once more
 * through `newerSchemaVersion`'s own guard (atomic-store.ts:136-144, unchanged by this item).
 * That is THREE reads and ONE write for the whole loop — not the "exactly one read, exactly
 * one write" the go-card's done-when states verbatim. Round 1 (code-reviewer, S5) found the
 * FIRST of those three elidable: when nothing in the whole loop actually changed, `add()` now
 * cancels a pending `remove()` instead of rebuilding an identical entry, so `pending` ends the
 * loop empty and `flush()` returns before its own re-read — ONE read, ZERO writes, also
 * measured below. The claim this test actually proves, and the one that matters, is that the
 * count is CONSTANT in the number of libraries refreshed, not the literal "1" — a 3-library
 * and a 30-library refresh cost the same reads and writes either way. Reported to Tom as such;
 * see the phase report for the full disposition of this done-when.
