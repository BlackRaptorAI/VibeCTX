     * on disk (the fast path, into `confirmed`). Before B1's fix, `pending` was cleared only
     * when it held `"remove"` — a prior real `pending` BUILD for the same key was left in
     * place, so `flush()` would still WRITE that superseded, stale content to disk (not merely
     * mis-set `memo`; the guard on the `confirmed` commit loop added alongside B1 prevents the
     * memo error, but does nothing to stop the wrong bytes from landing in the file). The
     * test above cannot catch this: it exercises the opposite order, which the "build" branch's
     * own `confirmed.delete(key)` already guarded before this round.
