/**
 * PAR-659 · D-37 — performance is MEASURED, not asserted.
 *
 * Two claims are made about `search` and both are proved here rather than described:
 *   1. a warm search over ≥ 10 indexed documents totalling ≥ 5 MB answers in under 300 ms
 *      (the number in the issue), and the measurement is PRINTED so a reader of the run sees
 *      the figure rather than a green tick;
 *   2. the index is actually USED — a warm search tokenizes no document at all, while the same
 *      search with the index deleted tokenizes the whole corpus.
 *
 * Claim 2 is proved by instrumenting the tokenizer itself, not by trusting a counter `search`
 * keeps about its own behaviour: `../src/tokenize.js` is mocked with a wrapper that delegates
 * to the REAL implementation and records every call, so ranking is unchanged and the count is
 * the ground truth. (`splitSections` is deliberately not counted: it does not tokenize, and
 * re-splitting a cached document is exactly the price D-33 charges for keeping no text in the
 * index.)
 *
 * The timing is machine-dependent by nature. It is reported with the machine's own numbers and
 * asserted against 300 ms; a failure here is a real regression on THIS machine, and the printed
 * figure is what a reader should carry forward, never the threshold.

 * which every token is globally unique is the opposite extreme and is measured here rather
 * than left to be discovered.
 *
 * No 300 ms assertion is made on this shape, because it is not the shape D-37 sets the budget
 * over and pretending otherwise would either overstate the guarantee or invite quietly
 * loosening the real one. What IS asserted is what must hold whatever the corpus: the answer
