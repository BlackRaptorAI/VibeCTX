Install the package and run it.

## Configuration

Set the cache directory with DOCS_CACHE_DIR. TTL defaults to seven days.

## Plugins

Fastify plugins are registered with the register method. Encapsulation matters.

# Advanced

## Streaming replies

Use reply.raw for streaming. Backpressure is your problem.

   * A6 (PAR-719), round 1 (test-auditor, F1) — the sections-mode analogue of

   * pricing had NO test anywhere that would catch its removal: `assemble`/`selectSections` are
   * called only from `get-docs.ts`, where the final `clipToBudget` backstop absorbs any
   * overshoot this function itself produces, and the pre-existing tests above assert no length
   * bound at all.
   *
   * Round 2 (code-reviewer): the boundary is DERIVED from the two chunks' actual rendered
   * lengths and the real `SECTION_ASSEMBLE_JOIN`, not a hardcoded literal — so this stays
   * discriminating if the separator string or the fixture's rendered sizes ever change. Set to
   * exactly `chunk1 + chunk2`: with the join priced at zero (the pre-fix bug), both chunks fit
   * and `assemble`'s own per-chunk-to-full-budget clipping renders both in full, overshooting
   * by exactly `SECTION_ASSEMBLE_JOIN.length`; with the join priced correctly, the 2nd chunk no
   * longer fits and `selectSections` stops at one.
   *
   * Round 4 (code-reviewer, S1) — `chosen.length` was asserted `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(1)`,
   * which every non-empty input satisfies and does not test THIS function at all: mutating
   * `selectSections`' own join pricing back to zero (leaving `assemble` correct) survived the
   * whole suite. Tightened to `toBe(1)`, the number `selectSections` alone must return once its
   * join is priced; verified this kills that exact mutant (`expected 2 to be 1`).
