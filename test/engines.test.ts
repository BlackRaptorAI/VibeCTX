/**
 * R-1/PAR-829, D-80/D-81: `package.json`'s `engines.node` is the INTERSECTION of `vite`'s and
 * `vitest`'s own declared ranges, hand-derived, not read from either at build time — nothing
 * else would catch either dependency narrowing its range out from under it.
 *
 * A prior version of this test compared `engines.node` to `vite`'s range by STRING EQUALITY
 * alone. That passed even after `vitest` bumped to a version whose own range (`^20.0.0 ||
 * ^22.0.0 || >=24.0.0`) is narrower than `vite`'s in the 22.x/23.x band — because the test
 * never looked at `vitest`'s range at all. A range can be a false claim of support without
 * ever equalling the wrong thing: `>=22.12.0` (no upper bound) legitimately equals nothing
 * `vite` didn't say, yet still admits Node 23.x, which `vitest` does not support (`^22.0.0`
 * stops before 23.0.0; the next band starts at `>=24.0.0` — nothing covers 23.x). Equality
 * against one dependency cannot catch a violation of the other's constraint.
 *
 * The correct invariant is SUBSET, checked against BOTH dependencies independently, using a
 * real semver range library rather than hand-rolled interval math — `semver.subset()` handles
 * `^`/`||`/prerelease-boundary normalization correctly; a hand-written check would not (the
 * exact class of bug this item exists to prevent, one level up).
