/**
 * PAR-659 · D-38 — THE INDEX IS KEYED TO THE CODE THAT BUILT IT.
 *
 * The search index carries a content hash per document, and that hash is what makes a stale or
 * planted entry harmless. It is also exactly why a change to the RETRIEVAL CODE slips past it:
 * the bytes are unchanged, so the hash matches, while the postings on disk are filed under
 * terms today's tokenizer no longer produces. The result is not a wrong answer, which someone
 * would notice — it is an EMPTY one.
 *
 * MEASURED by the PAR-659 schema gate: deleting the stemmer's `ies→y` rule made a surviving
 * index return zero groups where a freshly built index returns the right section.
 *
 * This file runs that experiment. `../src/tokenize.js` is replaced by a COPY OF THE MODULE
 * whose stemmer maps `policies` the way a build without the `ies→y` rule would (to `polici`
 * rather than `policy`) — everything else identical — and, in the second case, whose
 * `RETRIEVAL_VERSION` is bumped, which is precisely what the comment at that site instructs a
 * developer to do. Both halves are asserted:
 *
 *   - WITHOUT the bump, the surviving index is used and the search returns nothing. That is the
 *     failure D-38 exists to prevent, and it is proved here rather than described.
 *   - WITH the bump, `readIndex` refuses the file, the document is re-tokenized on the spot,
 *     and the right section comes back.
